# DA_jobseeker_bahaviour
This data I made when I worked at a Job Portal company in VietNam. This portal was still new and it had just receive investment since the beginning of 2021. 
Some terms you may confuse about the data:
- Full CV: the profile of your account
- Mini CV: the information Job seeker will fill when they apply for the job
- Inserted ad: the article of a Job seeker publish on the Portal to show their information, experience, etc. When Recruiter read the article and he thinks that this candidate is suitable, he wiil connect with that Job seeker
